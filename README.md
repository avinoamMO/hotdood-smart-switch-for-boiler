- The off the heater.
- Turn on the heater, with an automatic set-off timer set by the user (0-120 minutes)
- Set a weekly schedule for the heater's operation.

To be developed:

- Customizable quick-action buttons.
- Usage log and analytics (the current module displays mock data).
- Device management module including the possibility of automatic shut-down after a user-specified time period of continous operation.
- User management settings including a 'kid mode' for users and user-specific permissions.
